# dataAnalysis

Hello there, <br>
Greetings! <br>
I am Kwang-Chul Kwon who is an enthusiast in data analysis. I created my own depository here to share my codes with other people those who are interested in data analysis skills. Of course, I eagerly want to hear some feedback and advice on my codes from you. I am going to keep adding  codes associated with data analysis using python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, tkinter, scipy and so on).  Also, I am going to add Excel-based data analysis skills using excel chart, pivot table, power pivot data model, excel dashboard as well as Power BI.  Thanks all of those who read this README!!!
