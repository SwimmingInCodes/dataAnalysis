# dataAnalysis

Hello there, <br>

Greetings! <br>

I am Kwang-Chul Kwon who is an enthusiast in data analysis. I created my own depository here to share my codes with other people who are interested in data analysis skills. Of course, I eagerly want to hear some feedback and advice about my codes from you. I am going to keep adding codes associated with data analysis using python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, tkinter, scipy, and so on) and R languages.  Also, I am going to add Excel-based data analysis skills such as excel charts, pivot tables, power pivot data model, excel dashboard, and Power BI. Thanks to all of those who read this README!!!
