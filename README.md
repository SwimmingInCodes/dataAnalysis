# dataAnalysis

Hello there,
Greetings! <br>
I have just created my first git_hub depository which is to improve my coding skills and retrieve them whenever I need them. Also, I would like to share my codes with other people those who are interested in data analysis skills. Of course, I eagerly want to hear some feedback and advice on my codes from you. For this folder, I would like to keep adding various codes associated with data analysis skills using python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, tkinter, scipy and so on).  Also, I am going to add Excel-based data analysis techniques using excel chart, pivot table, power pivot data model, excel dashboard as well as Power BI.  Thanks all of those who read this README!!!
